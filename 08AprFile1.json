      "description": "<p>Managing a Franchise System requires that all users have access to timely and reliable information that is appropriate for their role. Yet, crucial information can be siloed in disparate applications limiting the ability to get a complete view across the entire franchise, reducing the efficiency of users performing their daily tasks. Getting a collection of enterprise applications to effectively work together can tie-up the IT resources needed to develop and maintain an integrated solution or perhaps is outside the core capabilities of the organization. To help meet this need while addressing the challenge, FranConnect offers several options for integrating FranConnect Sky with other business software.</p><p><h4 class=\"western\">Off-the Shelf Integrations</h4>A number of popular third-party business applications are available for integration with your FranConnect Sky system. Using FranConnect-provided, pre-built integrations provide additional functionality such as document e-signature, lead assessment, and brand reputation management.</p><p><h4 class=\"western\">FranConnect Delivered Integrations</h4>Customers can also choose to have FranConnect deliver and maintain an integrated solution. Working with the customer to understand their work processes, the applications that need to be integrated, and the desired outcome, FranConnect can propose a solution that best meets the customer’s business requirements.</p><h4 class=\"western\">Customer Initiated Integrations</h4><p>FranConnect makes available documented REST APIs for several FranConnect Sky application modules. Providing the greatest degree of control, customers can use these APIs to develop and support custom integrations using their own in-house or third-party development resources.</p><h4 class=\"western\">FranConnect APIs</h4><p>FranConnect APIs enable users to import and/or export data between FranConnect Sky and third-party applications. APIs make HTTP calls using the standard HTTP POST method in \"x-www-form-urlencoded\" format. You must provide the input to the API as an XML string whereas the output can either be in XML or JSON format, depending on how you would like to receive the response in your application. Various operations can be performed with the API by appending (and, thereby, replacing) variables in the request URL. FranConnect APIs support the following operations: login, module, subModule, query, create, update, retrieve, delete, log, and logout.</p><p>To perform the create and/or update operations, you must pass the attributes for the specific record in an xmlString. To perform the retrieve and/or delete operations, you must specify the parameters and their values in the filterXML. Other parameters that are used to specify the request (such as module name and sub module name) must be appended in the request as URL parameters.</p><h4 class=\"western\">Getting Started</h4><p>Contact the helpdesk team (<a href=\"mailto:helpdesk@franconnect.com\">helpdesk@franconnect.com</a>) to get the Client ID, Client Secret, and redirect URI that are required to generate the access token.</p><h4 class=\"western\">Supported Modules</h4><p>The FranConnect API provides access to all entities in the FranConnect system within the Finance (manage-finance), Sales (fs), Info Manager  (fim), CRM (cm), and the Admin (admin) modules.</p><h4 class=\"western\">Rate Limits and Accounts</h4><p>The FranConnect API does not impose any rate limit restrictions at present, but the users are expected to retrieve data after certain interval and retrieve only the deltas (wherever applicable) so as to not overload the system. Retrieving a large dataset might result in slowness and impede the overall system performance.</p><h4 class=\"western\">Concurrent Requests</h4><p>The FranConnect API does not support concurrent requests and the requests must be made one at a time.</p><h4 class=\"western\">Testing</h4><p>You can perform testing in your UAT environment and then move the code over to your production environment. In case you don’t have a UAT environment, you can request for one from your customer advocate or by sending an email to our HelpDesk team (<a href=\"mailto:helpdesk@franconnect.com\">helpdesk@franconnect.com</a>). A temporary UAT environment can be provided to you, but there might be some cost associated with it.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(184, 49, 47);\"><strong>Important!</strong> This document uses <strong>Postman</strong> as the GUI client for testing the FranConnect API. However, you can emulate the API using your preferred programming language.</span></p>"

It is possible to pull multiple stores but not multiple attributes in a single request. For multiple attributes, you must send multiple requests. <br><strong>If attribute is a field:</strong> Yes, the API can pull multiple fields for multiple stores in a single request for a single tab. And, in response, it will retrieve all the fields of that particular tab.</li><li><b>Can the API send comma delimited location ID (multiple locations) in a single request? We are assuming Location ID is the internal Location reference ID and not the Franchisee ID displayed on Center Info.</b> <br><strong>For create/update/delete operation:</strong> No, the API cannot send comma delimited location ID. <br><strong>For retrieve operation:</strong> Yes, the API can send comma delimited location ID<li><b>Can the API query back from a custom field (Location Number)?</b> <br>Yes, the API can pull from any of the custom field, if it is exportable and searchable.</li><li><b>Does the API support Unicode input?</b><br>No, the API does not support Unicode inputs. It supports data input through UTF-8.<li><b>Encountered the Error “HTTP 401 Status Code” while setting up OAuth 2.0 Authentication.</b><br>Ensure that you are using the correct Client ID and Client Secret pair provided by the FranConnect for setting up OAuth 2.0 Authentication.<li><b>Encountered the Error “HTTP 404 Status Code” with the message “Not Found” while performing Retrieve operation such as Retrieve Schema, Retrieve CRM Leads or Retrieve the List of Modules through the API.</b><br>Ensure that you are using the correct context path in the request URL as per your Tenant.

For the FranConnect API, limit can have a maximum value of 100. </p><p>To get a paginated response for your retrieve request, you must define how many records you want to retrieve, using the <strong>limit </strong>parameter, and from where would the records be starting from, using the <strong>offset </strong>parameter. For example, if your response dataset contains more than 100 records, you must use pagination as \"offset=0&limit=100\". For the next iteration, you must use pagination as \"offset=100&limit=100\". Note that the response data also contains a flag <strong> \"hasMoreRecords=true\"</strong> which indicates that there are more records remaining to be paginated.</p><p>Following is an example of the limit and offset parameters used for a Retrieve operation using the Sales sub-module.
